# MetaMusic
MetaMusic is a metadata tag editor that uses an [unofficial Youtube Music API](https://pypi.org/project/ytmusicapi/) to apply tags to mp3 files.

## Installation
Install Python3 and these packages using pip or a Python package manager of your choice.

```
pip install argparse mutagen ytmusicapi requests
```

Copy the index.py file to the /usr/local/bin directory and rename the file to what you would like to invoke on the command line (mm in this case):
```
cp index.py /usr/local/bin/mm
```
With the installed libraries MetaMusic should be ready to use.
